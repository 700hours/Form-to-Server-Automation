Current format: a form will be filled out on the website, and place a file,
"serverparams.cmd"
"Update.bat" will be automated to delete the old serverparams, and download a new one.
"senderror.bat" is intended to email the user. The user's email may in the serverparams. The current clause for checking for an error "%name%==default" is a placeholder.
"sendservfull.bat" will email the user if available RAM is less than 1600.
"randomport.exe" generates a unique port
"sysresourceoutput.exe" outputs physical RAM left

You're probably familiar with wget. Maybe blat?

"Activeports.txt" and "chosenport.cmd" need to exist to avoid error, though they're created anyway.. just stalls.

"createserver.bat" writes the server variable files, and starts the server for first use. "%name%_start.bat," "%name%_set.cmd", "%name%_config.txt" will use for migrate.
