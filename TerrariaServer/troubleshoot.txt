You can find the necessary Terraria server files for TShock and Vanilla Terraria at \
these sites:
https://github.com/Pryaxis/TShock/releases
http://terraria.org/ (the Dedicated Server link is at the very bottom)

Until I create a ".reg" file that registers the location of the directory, 
"TerrariaServer," keep "TerrariaServer" on your desktop or the internal directory 
calls will fail

To manually create a server based on the values in "chosenport.cmd" and 
"serverparams.cmd" located in "filebin," without editing the file, run 
"createserver.bat" or "createserver_tshock.bat;" these .bat will create the necessary
files for starting and restarting the server in the future

To run a specific server after it has been closed, simply run the "%name%_start.bat"
file

In order to change the values of a server, such as what world is used or the player
limit, simply edit them in the "%name%_config.txt" file (%name%_config_ts.txt for
TShock)

If the TShock server program isn't booted up by the automation, simply run the 
necessary "%name%_start_ts.bat"
